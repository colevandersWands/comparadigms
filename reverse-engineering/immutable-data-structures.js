  Structured programming is based around data structures and subroutines.

  The subroutines are where the recipe is implemented, and the data structures are simply containers for the information needed by those subroutines.

  OOP shifts the primary focus to the data itself.

  Procedural: "what do I want to do and what will I need to know to do it"

  OOP: "what kind of things do I need to have and what can those things do for me".

  Procedural: functions first and then devise data structures to support them.

  OOP: design types first and then the operations needed to work with them.
